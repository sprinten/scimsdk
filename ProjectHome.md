The UnboundID SCIM SDK may be used to interact with various types of SCIM-enabled endpoints (such as the UnboundID server products) to perform lightweight, cloud-based identity management via the [SCIM Protocol](http://www.simplecloud.info). A reference implementation of a SCIM service provider and client are provided, which are built on the UnboundID SCIM SDK, [UnboundID LDAP SDK](https://www.unboundid.com/products/ldapsdk), and other open source libraries.
